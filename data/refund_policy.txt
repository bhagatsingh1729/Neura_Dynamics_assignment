1. Overview
We want our customers to be fully satisfied with their purchases. This Refund Policy
describes the conditions under which refunds may be requested and processed.

- The product must be returned in its original packaging, including all accessories,
  manuals, and documentation.

4. Refund Process
To initiate a refund, customers must contact customer support within the eligible refund

to return the product.

Returned items are inspected upon receipt. If the return is approved after inspection,
the refund will be processed to the original payment method.

5. Refund Timeline

returned item has been received and approved. Depending on the payment provider, it may
take additional time for the refund to appear on the customer’s statement.
