CANCELLATION POLICY

1. Order Cancellation Window
Customers may cancel their orders within twenty-four (24) hours of placing the order,
provided the order has not yet been processed or shipped.

2. Orders in Processing
Once an order has entered the processing stage, cancellation may not be guaranteed.
Customers are advised to contact customer support as soon as possible to request a
cancellation.

3. Shipped Orders
Orders that have already been shipped cannot be cancelled. In such cases, customers
must wait until the product is delivered and then refer to the Refund Policy for return
eligibility.

4. How to Request Cancellation
Cancellation requests must be submitted through official customer support channels.
Requests submitted via social media or third-party platforms will not be considered
official cancellation requests.

5. Refunds for Cancelled Orders
If an order is successfully cancelled within the allowed time frame, a full refund will
be issued to the original payment method. Refunds for cancelled orders are processed
within three (3) to five (5) business days.

6. Subscription Cancellations
For subscription-based products or services, customers may cancel their subscription at
any time. However, cancellation will take effect at the end of the current billing cycle,
and no partial refunds will be provided for unused time.

7. Exceptional Circumstances
In rare cases, such as system errors or duplicate orders, customer support may approve
cancellations outside the standard cancellation window at their discretion.

8. Policy Changes
This Cancellation Policy may be updated from time to time. Customers should review the
policy periodically to stay informed of any updates.
